## [1.1.2] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- Release workflow: explicit `.npmrc` in package directory so npm publish authenticates correctly (fixes ENEEDAUTH).
- Release workflow: Node 24 LTS, `id-token: write` for provenance.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- Remove unnecessary whitespace in `updateTask` (tasks application layer).
- package.json: normalize `repository.url` to `git+https://...` and bin path for npm publish.
